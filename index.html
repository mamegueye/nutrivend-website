  <!-- Problem Section -->
  <section class="problem">
    <div class="container">
      <h3>Our survey revealed a troubling truth:</h3>
      <p class="highlight">Over half of UIUC students skip at least 1–2 meals every week. Not because they want to—because they have no choice.</p>

      <div class="scenario">
        <h3>Imagine This:</h3>
        <p>You're rushing between Bio Lab and your Economics lecture. Your stomach is growling, but the dining hall is a 15-minute walk each way. You have 20 minutes total.</p>
        <p class="bold">What do you do?</p>
        <ul class="options">
          <li class="bad-option">Grab another bag of chips from a traditional vending machine?</li>
          <li class="bad-option">Skip lunch entirely...again?</li>
          <li class="good-option">Or imagine instead: Walking up to a NutriVend station right in your building, selecting a hot, balanced meal, and enjoying it within minutes?</li>
